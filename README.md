# STEFFECT

Steffect is a responsive e-commerce websire for fashionable sunglasses. Steffect is a new business, and I was given the task to design and build their website. I made the design using Adobe XD, with Steffect's owner giving me the colours and heading font to use, along with some existing websites for design inspiration. 

For building Steffect, I worked with Ryan Adrian (https://github.com/Rainandray-netizen) and used Strapi and Stripe. I handled all of the HTML and Sass to build the web pages, whilst Ryan integrated Strapi and Stripe into the website, and handled the website functionality with React.

### Live Website:

## Personal Learnings

This project was my first experience with Strapi and Stripe, and has been the biggest project I have done so far.
